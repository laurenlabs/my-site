				<h3>Inspiring a New Generation of Developers</h3>

				<p>In my wildest dreams, I never thought that I would become a software developer. I thought that I wasn't smart enough, that I needed a computer science degree and to have been writing code since I was young. But, the traditional path to becoming a developer is changing. This talk will focus on alternative and untraditional paths to becoming a developer such as programs like <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a>, <a href="http://www.bloc.io">mentorship</a>, and apprentice programs. These alternative paths ultimately foster a more diverse and inclusive community, which drives economic growth and produces more innovative solutions. 

				<p class="objectives">The objectives of the talk are: 

					<ul>
						<li>to bring awareness to the educational alternatives to computer science degrees <br>
						<li> to encourage empathy when mentoring a beginner <br>
						<li>to get the audience to see a different perspective and embrace differences in the industry<br>
					</ul>

	<p class="summary">As someone with basically no working knowledge of Ruby, most of the talks at <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> went way over my head, especially the one by the creator of Ruby, Matz. The most entertaining presentation was by <a href="http://www.Artoo.io">Artoo.io</a>, but the one that changed my life was by Kinsey Ann Durham.</p>
