			<h3>Inspiring a New Generation of Developers</h3>
			<h3>Speaker: Kinsey Ann Durham</h3>
			<p>In my wildest dreams, I never thought that I would become a software developer. I thought that I wasn't smart enough, that I needed a computer science degree and to have been writing code since I was young. But, the traditional path to becoming a developer is changing. This talk will focus on alternative and untraditional paths to becoming a developer such as programs like <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a>, <a href="http://www.bloc.io">mentorship</a>, and apprentice programs. These alternative paths ultimately foster a more diverse and inclusive community, which drives economic growth and produces more innovative solutions.
			<p>Objectives:</p>
			<ul class="square">
						<li><strong>To bring awareness</strong> to the educational alternatives to computer science degrees</li> 
						<li><strong>To encourage empathy</strong> when mentoring a beginner </li>
						<li>To get the audience to see a different perspective and <strong>embrace differences</strong> in the industry</li>
			</ul>

				<p class="summary">As someone with basically no working knowledge of Ruby, most of the talks at <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> went way over my head, especially the one by the creator of Ruby, Matz. The most entertaining presentation was by <a href="http://www.Artoo.io">Artoo.io</a>, but the one that changed my life was by Kinsey Ann Durham.</p>
